## Project Template

The purpose for this repository is to have a quick project template that can be used on new vanilla js and scss projects.

This project comes with webpack and babel pre-configured.


### Scripts:

### `npm run build`

This will simply run a script that will generate a build file with all your js and scss bundled together.

### `npm run dev-server`

Runs a development server on https://localhost:8000 that allows you to view your code changes and hot-reloads the webpage when changes are made.
